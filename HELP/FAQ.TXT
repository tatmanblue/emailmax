II  When can the SMTP/POP server be different?

There are several reasons why the SMTP or POP may be different than your email account.  Mainly it has to do with security.  

One of the most common reasons it can be different, is if you connected to the interent through a provider other than one that setup the account for you.   Many providers will  examine the TCP packets for a destination IP that belongs to there IP group and will reject access to those who are not part of the group.  



III What is POP?

POP stands for Post Office Protocol and is used to store received email messages until you can retrieve and remove them from the computer.



IV  What is SMTP?

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.  Computers that support SMTP are used to send email through the internet.
